### Project Description: Game Data Capture and AI Integration

<p>This project provides a comprehensive solution for capturing custom data in games and storing it in a database. It aims to facilitate the interaction between games and AI Language Models, such as ChatGPT, by leveraging a digital program to save game states. The project offers modularity, allowing developers to customize and adapt it to fit the specific limitations, needs, and desires of their games.</p>

## Key Features:

1. Custom Data Capture (In Development): The project enables the capture of game-specific data, allowing developers to define and store custom information in a database. This flexibility ensures that the captured data aligns with the unique requirements of each game.

2. AI Language Model Integration (Planned): By integrating with AI Language Models like ChatGPT, the project facilitates the seamless interaction between games and advanced natural language processing capabilities. This integration opens up possibilities for enhanced game experiences, intelligent conversations, and dynamic storytelling.

3. Modular Design: The project follows a modular architecture, enabling developers to easily modify and extend its functionality. This flexibility ensures that the system can adapt to various game limitations, requirements, and preferences. Developers can selectively integrate specific modules or build upon the existing ones to create a tailored solution.

4. Text-Based Engine and Database Interface (Planned): The project serves as the foundation for a text-based game engine that empowers developers to track game progress and manage game-related data. It seamlessly interfaces with a PostgreSQL database, enabling efficient and reliable storage, retrieval, and querying of game-related information.

By combining the ability to capture custom game data, interact with AI Language Models, and offer modularity for flexibility, this project provides a powerful toolset for developers to create immersive and dynamic gaming experiences while effectively tracking and managing game-related data with the support of PostgreSQL.
